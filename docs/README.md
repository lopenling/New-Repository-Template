# Setting up the docs

1) Go through `_coverpage.md` and search for `~` to find all the values that have to be changed
2) Go through `_index.md` and search for `~` to find all the values that have to be changed
3) Replace the url `EditOnGithubPlugin` value in `index.html` with the url of the repo where the docs reside
4) Add your content as individual markup files in the root, or sub-directories
5) Add links to your content to `_siderbar.md`
